## This file sets the qsub variables that are used in the batch queueing system
## As SPANDx will run with PBS as the default scheduler please specify below if you are using SGE or SLURM
## note that SPANDx will currently only work with SGE,  PBS and SLURM systems. Default is PBS.

SCHEDULER=SLURM #current options must be one of either PBS or SGE or SLURM or NONE. 

#Handling of standard error N/A for SGE systems
#{oe,eo,n}. oe merges standard error to standard output, eo merges standard output to standard error, n indicates neither and two separate files will result
#PBS
ERROR_OUTPUT=oe

# SLURM and PBS memory handling
# If you would like to alter the amount of memory assigned to SLURM jobs please modify the following variable
# Specified in the sbatch scripts as --mem=$SLURM_MEM
SLURM_MEM=8GB
PBS_MEM=4096mb

#TO DO
# Add SGE memory management. 
# Adding '-l h_vmem=8G' after the walltime request will fix memory issues in SGE until implemented

#SGE options are no or yes
ERROR_OUT_SGE=yes

# walltime
# by default jobs are submitted to qsub with 12 hours wall time
#PBS
WALL_T=96:00:00
#SGE
H_RT=42000
#SLURM
TIME=0-96:0:00

# mail
# Options for the way job e-mail is handled is flagged with -m within the qsub line
# {a,b,e,n}. a - when job is aborted by PBS, b - when job begins, e - when job terminates
# By default no mail will be sent with SPANDx. Default settings are recommended as SPANDx can spawn a large number of jobs if there are several sequences to be analysed. If mail is desired please change the variables below
# Eg to enable aborted and terminated job e-mail "MAIL=ae" and set ADDRESS=your.email@address.com
#PBS and SGE
MAIL=n

#SLURM
MAIL_SLURM=NONE
#BOTH
ADDRESS=user@university.edu
