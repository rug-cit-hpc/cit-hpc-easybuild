description = """CFOUR (Coupled-Cluster techniques for Computational Chemistry) is a program package for performing
 high-level quantum chemical calculations on atoms and molecules. The major strength of the program suite is its 
 rather sophisticated arsenal of high-level ab initio methods for the calculation of atomic and molecular properties.
 Virtually all approaches based on MÃ¸ller-Plesset (MP) perturbation theory and the coupled-cluster approximation (CC)
 are available; most of these have complementary analytic derivative approaches within the package as well."""
